Here's a simple Twitch helper that separates your chat, events and viewers and displays them in a clean and focused UI. Meant to be displayed on a second monitor.

## How To Set Up
1. Download code as zip (or clone it if you're technical).
2. Open script.js. You can do that in notepad
3. Replace "YOUR TWITCH CHANNEL NAME HERE" in `var channelName = "YOUR TWITCH CHANNEL NAME HERE";` (literally the fourth line in the file) with "your Twitch channel name". Leave the quotes around your channel name.
4. Run index.html while you strum.
5. ???
6. Profit.
